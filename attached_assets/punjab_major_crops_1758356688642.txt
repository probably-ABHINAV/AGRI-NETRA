Sugarcane	Cashcrop (Industrial)	High — long duration crop; frequent irrigation; total water demand very high (seasonal).	High nutrient demand: NPK ~150-200:50-100:50 kg/ha (site-specific). Organic: FYM 10 t/acre beneficial. Micronutrients: Zn, S, B as per test.	Management of top borer, white grub, red rot — follow PAU/ICAR chemical & cultural control guidance; apply pesticides per label and quarantine rules for industrial crop.
